# BINNF - Bio-Inspired Neural Network Framework

This project is looking for creating a framework for easily creating and simulating Bio-Inspired Neural Networks based on dynamical systems. Currently this framework supports creating networks whose cells/units follow the mean firing rate concept. In the future it should be possible to simulate other kind of cells/units.
